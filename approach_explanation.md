Approach Explanation: Smart Document Analyzer
Overview
Our Smart Document Analyzer is a sophisticated PDF processing system that combines traditional document parsing techniques with modern relevance scoring to extract and prioritize the most important sections from multiple PDF documents based on a specific user persona and their job-to-be-done. The system operates entirely offline, making it suitable for secure environments and hackathon constraints.
Core Methodology
1. Multi-Stage Document Processing Pipeline
The system implements a modular, four-stage processing pipeline:
Stage 1: PDF Reading & Text Extraction
Utilizes pdfminer.six for robust text and layout extraction
Preserves font size, positioning, and formatting information
Handles complex document layouts and multilingual content
Extracts text elements with their spatial coordinates and typographic features
Stage 2: Intelligent Section Detection
Implements heuristic-based heading identification using multiple criteria:
Font size analysis with dynamic threshold calculation
Text pattern recognition (numbered headings, title case, all caps)
Semantic keyword matching for common section types
Position-based hierarchy determination
Classifies headings into H1, H2, H3 levels using statistical quantiles
Groups content under appropriate headings based on spatial relationships
Stage 3: Relevance Scoring & Ranking
Dual scoring approach with graceful fallback:
Primary Method: Sentence transformer embeddings for semantic similarity
Fallback Method: Keyword-based scoring with weighted matching
Combines heading title and content for comprehensive relevance assessment
Applies persona-specific weighting and job-to-be-done alignment
Ranks sections by importance score (0-10 scale)
Stage 4: Structured Output Generation
Creates individual JSON output files for each processed PDF
Includes comprehensive metadata (persona, job, timestamps)
Provides top 10 most relevant sections per document
Generates automatic summaries and content excerpts
2. Adaptive Relevance Scoring System
Embedding-Based Scoring (Primary)
Uses pre-trained all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model (~80MB) for semantic understanding
Computes cosine similarity between job description and section content
Provides nuanced understanding of semantic relationships
Handles complex queries and diverse document types
Keyword-Based Scoring (Fallback)
Extracts meaningful keywords from job description
Implements stop-word filtering and keyword weighting
Provides exact phrase matching bonuses
Includes heading level bonuses (H1 > H2 > H3)
Ensures system reliability when ML models are unavailable
3. User-Centric Design
Interactive Configuration
Prompts users for persona and job-to-be-done at runtime
Provides examples and guidance for optimal input
Validates and sanitizes user input
Offers default values for quick testing

Innovation Highlights
1. Hybrid Scoring Approach
Combines semantic understanding with traditional keyword matching, ensuring both accuracy and reliability.
2. Dynamic Heading Classification
Uses statistical analysis of document font sizes rather than fixed thresholds, adapting to various document styles.
3. Persona-Driven Analysis
Goes beyond simple keyword matching to understand user intent and context, providing more relevant results.
4. Comprehensive Metadata
Includes processing timestamps, file information, and configuration details for complete audit trails.
Conclusion
Our Smart Document Analyzer represents a balanced approach to document intelligence, combining the reliability of traditional parsing techniques with the sophistication of modern NLP. The system's modular design, offline operation, and adaptive scoring make it suitable for real-world deployment while meeting all hackathon constraints. The focus on user experience, comprehensive logging, and structured outputs ensures that the system is both powerful and practical for end users.
